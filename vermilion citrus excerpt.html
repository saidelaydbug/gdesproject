    <h2>here is an excerpt from an ongoing modern fantasy romance project i'm writing called "vermilion citrus".</h2>
    <p>
      Loretta doesn't know why she hasn't gone home. She should’ve gone home-- she’s spent years making it her personal sanctuary of tranquility and quiet, so naturally it should be her place of refuge amongst this mental turmoil. <br>
But perhaps that's it, isn't it? The quiet. <br>
Somehow in these months since a star moved in next door, Loretta has found more comfort in chatter than in the silence she taught herself to love. Her home is still undoubtedly home, still the treasure box for her past, present, and future, but sometimes the spaces feel as though they’re emptier than they really are. Like there’s something… missing. <br>
Maybe that’s why she’s standing on Clementine’s doorstep, hand hovering moments from the piercing ring of a knock. Maybe that’s why she’d let herself become attached to this sunbeam of a woman at all. <br>
Vampires should be repulsed by sunlight, and yet-- exists Clementine. Loretta should consider herself more of a moth than a vampire, then, if she’s drawn so inexorably to Clementine’s light. After all, how could one not adore the way she brightens up a room merely by entering it? The way her eyes carry some brilliant, curious shine to them whenever she looks at Loretta? The way she so effortlessly illuminates a path in darkness to a place warm and safe? <br>
Oh dear. <br>
It seems that Loretta has become something of an Icarus-- but will falling into this sea truly be so bad?
