    <p class="bubble">why were such beautiful things as stars, nebulas, and galaxies created only to be entirely toxic to us and so far away?</p>
    <p class="bubble2">maybe that's the point though, their distance. maybe it's to push us to the very limits of our weak minds and feeble bodies just to reach and see them for real-- to take a deep breath and know that the struggle was entirely worth it.</p>
    <p class="bubble3">but why, fate, did you perfectly assemble just the right atoms to make me in the same universe that you assembled just the right atoms to make nebulas and have it so i can't ever be near them? why build me a home and kill me when i step inside?</p>
    <p class="bubble4">fate, are nebulas my sisters? you birthed us both, crafted us from the same age-old materials-- can I meet my distant relatives someday? will they tell me their secrets if i ask? they've lived so long and seen so much, maybe i could learn a thing or two from them.</p>
    <p class="bubble5">fate, do you live in fear that one day we will conquer you? or do you rest assured that your ineffable quality will defy us for as long as we live? i don't know which to believe in, and i doubt i'll live long enough to see, but i think you should think about it.</p>
    <p class="bubble6">i think i get it-- fate, you put the stars so far away because you knew, didn't you? you knew we didn't deserve to hold them in our hands. we only deserve the faint dreams of them as we send out metallic eyes to see them on our behalf.</p>
