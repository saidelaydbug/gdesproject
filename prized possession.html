    <p>
      though a generic choice, i would be lying if i didn't say the most important item that i own is my laptop. i encourage you to look at all my lovely stickers, because they make me so happy!
    <h3>why do i treasure it?</h3>
    <p>
      i treaure it because it allows me freedom in essentially innumerable ways. it gives me access to more information than i know what to do with, connects me with people when i otherwise never would have met or been able to keep in contact with them, and provides me with clean, easy access my two favorite types of creation: writing and drawing. i vastly prefer digital art and writing in google docs than to doing either by hand, so my laptop comes in handy in this aspect. i also love my laptop because it has all of my stickers on it, and stickers are an important source of joy and pride for me, so having them all on my laptop makes it that much more valuable to me than it already is.
    </p>
    <h3>how did you acquire the item?</h3>
    <p>
      i went to this technology store close to my house, the microcenter, with my dad and my older sister in august of 2022. we entered the store with the goal of getting me a new laptop for college and a new pair of headphones for my sister, and we left having achieved that goal.
    </p>
    <h3>what's its intrinsic value?</h3>
    <p>
      it has a fairly high intrinsic value, considering it's a nice, up-to-date laptop with an especially nice screen. i think the price my dad bought it at was around $1k-- which feels a little wild to me in terms of how much it is, even if i value it highly myself.
