    <h1>THESE THINGS ARE DELICIOUS.</h1>
    <p>
      i'm a little bit obsessed with these. i discovered them through the monthly subscription my parents have to this thing called universal yums, which sends you snacks from a different country around the world each month. one month we got snacks from france and i tried one of these strawberry chews and the moment the flavor hit my tongue my entire brain chemistry was altered. i love these things so much, whenever they pop into my brain its so difficult to get them out and i find myself salivating at the mere thought of them. i bought packs of them off the website(found <a href="https://www.universalyums.com/product/french-strawberry-chews"> here</a>, which is also where the image is from) and i miss always seeming to have some to snack on when i wanted some. i'm hoping to get some for the holidays or perhaps my birthday in may!
